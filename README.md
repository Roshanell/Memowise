Memowise is a full-stack application designed to help users manage and organize their study materials. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily create and manage study cards using manual input or automated generation via artificial intelligence.

Memowise uses the following Auth0, OpenAI, PixabayAPI, and Merriam WebsterAPI

The app uses React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, with user data is stored in a postgres database. Users can review their study decks and quiz themselves on concepts they have previously studied.

## Features

1. Streamlines the learning process for students and reduces workload for teachers.
2. Easy-to-use interface for managing study materials.
3. Manual and AI-based flashcard generation.
4. Supports audio and visual links for cards.
5. Efficient card management and filtering.
6. User authentication and secure data protection using Auth0.
7. Profile viewing and editing.
8. Knowledge testing with point-based scoring.
9. Teacher-specific features for student management and card oversight.
10. Integration of OpenAI, Pixabay, and Merriam-Webster APIs.

Memowise is a full-stack application designed to help users manage and organize their study materials. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily create and manage study cards using manual input or automated generation via artificial intelligence.

The app uses React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, with user data stored in a postgres database. Users can review their study decks and quiz themselves on concepts they have previously studied.

Additionally, the application allows users to filter through their cards and add or remove cards as needed. Teachers can also use the app to add and remove students, as well as view student statistics.

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
